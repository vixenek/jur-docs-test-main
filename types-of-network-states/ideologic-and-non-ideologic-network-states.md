Two main categories of Network States can be hypothesized and, as mentioned, infinite sub-categories:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ideology based Network</strong></td><td>example a Vegan Country or a Keto Kosher Country. They are based on a particular moral imperative or ethos, distinct from that of a society. The founding reason of the State lies in a particular vision of things, moral principles or similar.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Non-ideology based Network</strong></td><td>example, an ideal digital jurisdiction for online business with minimal taxation and services for super efficient online companies, ideal employment Law, efficiency of the Courts. The founding reason of the State does not reside in a particular vision of things or moral principles, but from considerations of an economic nature.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
