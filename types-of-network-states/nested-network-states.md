Nested Network State is a Network State that has obtained recognition from an existing jurisdiction.

For example, Nested Network State is a Network State that has obtained the status similar to a [Special Economic Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special\_economic\_zone) by a jurisdiction so that the entities, relationships, activities matured in the Network State are recognized as having legal value within that jurisdiction.

At present, there is no Nested Network State. Jur will contribute to the definition of the concept and to obtain a framework with existing jurisdictions.
