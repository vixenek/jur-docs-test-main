# ðŸ—º State and Nation

Throughout history, humankind has worked to define forms of human organization to ensure civil coexistence. They have evolved over the centuries. [The modern nation state is a relatively recent concept, arising only in the past three hundred years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation\_state)

A nation is a community that shares a set of common values: **language, norms, tradition, customs, and religion**. Historically nations were defined by an individual's place of birth.

The State is a form of human association distinguished for its purposeâ€“â€“ the establishment of order and security; its methods, the laws and their enforcement; its territory, the area of jurisdiction or geographic boundaries; and finally by its sovereignty.

State and nation are therefore two different concepts: the state implies the existence of an organized political body which exercises power over citizens of a nation, and to which the citizens confer power.
