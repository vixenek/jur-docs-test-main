# üè¥ The Lean Network State Model

Jur offers a complete, evolutionary, modular and agnostic stack to create societies, Network States and versions in between. To do this, Jur offers a number of self-contained components that can be used independently or together.

The constructive approach is based on the need to iterate together with the communities as they evolve.

The Network State movement is likely to be very dynamic - ideas and needs will change quickly as experiments succeed and fail. Jur stack will be developed using a ‚Äúlean development‚Äù approach. Efforts will be focused on serving immediate needs with minimal viable products, and rechecking user requirements regularly to match the pace of iteration in network state related social experiments.

A general overview of the direction of the project follows below. Technical documentation is included in the [Architecture](broken-reference) chapter. Jur is developing some essential functions and continues to grow, following user needs and constantly learning.
