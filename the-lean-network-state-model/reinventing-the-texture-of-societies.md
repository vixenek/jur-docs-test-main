# ðŸ§µ Reinventing The Texture Of Societies

Jur identifies trustless logics that allow the creation and maintenance of new organizational forms or the onboarding of existing ones. Jur redesigns the crossover between society and technology.

The choice we made in Jur is not to proceed with a top-down approach by designing complex engineering architectures. When it comes to social dynamics it is essential to consider their mutability and the fact that reinventing some of them requires experimentation.

Instead, we follow a bottom-up approach, prioritizing the creation of new Web3-native social cells and allowing them to evolve over time. The technical and system choices evolve with the evolution of the communities that use Jur. We therefore follow a lean approach favouring simplicity.

Jur as a modular substrate-based layer 1 offers maximum potential for:

* offer security
* unmatched upgradeability
