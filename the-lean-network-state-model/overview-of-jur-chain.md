* **Modular:** Use what you want
* **Flexible:** Each module has different variations of logics, so that a community can select a sub-category that serves their needs
* **Interoperable:** Interact with Jur Chain through cross-chain communication
* **Secure:** Connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain
* **User Friendly:** Jur offers a set of easy-to-use dApps that interact with the Jur Chain
* **Progressively Decentralized:** Starting with the sudo pallet for efficiency and speed of execution Jur Chain will progressively be decentralized until the runtime is completely managed by the JUR token holders
