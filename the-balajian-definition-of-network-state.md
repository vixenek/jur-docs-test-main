# üîç The Balajian Definition of Network State

In the book [The Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/), [Balaji Srinivasan](https://balajis.com/) gives an overview of a definition and vision of a Network State. It is based on some essential characteristics.

In Balaji's short definition a Network State consists of four elements.

More specifically, it is a social network with a sense of national consciousness, and a recognized leader. This social network has characteristics, such as a quality level of relationships and an integrated cryptocurrency that enables an internal economy.

In more mature stages, when a collective consciousness and organization is achieved, the social network coordinates its action and generates a consensual government limited by a social contract. The community at that point might seek political representation in physical enclaves around the world. Over time this community might have the necessary characteristics to achieve diplomatic recognition.
