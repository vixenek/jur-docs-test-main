#### A Web3 Citizenâ€™s Journey

Jurâ€™s stack provides for three phases of the lifecycle of a Web3 community. Imagine you are founding a society.

* **Society**: your community finds and determines its Ethos. Ethos is the set of shared values that bonds the members of the society together and guides their action. You as founder make Propositions that are voted on by members. The blockchain stores the history of votes, participation and their content constituting an indelible history of a new form of civilization.
* **Nation**: your community has developed a deep sense of belonging, cohesion, and shared purpose and comes to regard itself as a nation. This sense of unity is the essential characteristic. When your community decides to become a nation, it can designate a territory and represent itself under a unified symbol, the flag. Crowd-funding the purchase of land is an option, but the territory does not have to be physical. You could establish a virtual territory, like a Discord server, or a twitter profile.
* **State**: the community, which has decided to congregate in a territory and has its own Ethos determines a form of government, represented by a constitution which contains procedures for creating rules.

The model will allow you to issue a Society Token and develop a blockchain-based economy. Tools for creation and administration of public services and various models of government will be provided.

The power of this idea arises from the community, from the free choice of each individual to join a society that matches their personal values and be part of something bigger. Jur will operate from an agnostic position, taking on point of view no how societies should be organized but rather building flexible tools that allow people to create any kind of society they want.
