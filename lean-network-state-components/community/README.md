# ðŸ‘« Community

The Community, a body of people who decide to join together for one or more purposes, is the center of every organizational form. The basic form of the Community in Jur is called a Society. A Society is a Web-3 based community created by one or more Founders.

Founders of a Society are people or entities who intend to create new Societies that can eventually evolve into nations and states. The Founders identify initial values and access criteria for members of the Society.

The essential functioning of the Society is expressed through two elements:

* **status:** the status of being a member of a Society, represented by a dynamic NFT. Status encompasses the rights, duties and characteristics of the member of society.
* **vote:** the activity with which community members contribute on-chain to define the society.

The community in Jur is designed to allow members of a community, before organizing themselves for action, to define their own heritage of values and create an on-chain history together.

The module is based on the idea of a New Citizenship Journey. Jur enables the creation of communities that can evolve over time. Members become citizens when they agree on a model of government by signing an on-chain social contract. The Society, at that moment, becomes a State or a Network State.

Jur supports a founder-led Society model. While it might be possible for a group of equals to start a society, the Jur team believes that, like startup businesses, startup societies are likely to be created and driven initially by the passion of a single person.
