# ðŸ—£ On-Chain Polls

Members vote via on-chain polls to establish shared:

* **values**: those elements that the community considers as important in terms of values;
* **traditions**: for example the tradition of celebrating a particular day as a national day;
* **religion**: for example Christianity or new forms of religion, such as "jedism";
* **customs**: uses such as "leave space on the bus for pregnant women";
* **norms**: rules and basic principles of a community, such as for example;
* **history**: the most important votes are recorded as part of the history of the company;

Voting results will initially be determined by a simple majority of voters. Multiple voting models will be developed over time in response to user needs.

The goal is to allow members of a Society to establish common values on-chain and trace an on-chain history of the community itself which remains indelible and visible on-chain for any future member who intends to participate.

The structure of a Society and the voting mechanism are designed to be flexible and minimalistic. The Founder and the Community can use voting methods to shape the on-chain elements of coexistence however they like. For example, the concept of rule can accommodate very specific simple prescriptions, or refer to external sources (a PDF document) containing an extremely complex regulation.

The Society is flexible and can support Web3 Communities newly created from scratch, but also existing online Web2.0 communities that are strongly aligned. For example, NFT communities and already Web3 communities that support a crypto project.
