# ðŸ’¸ Trustless Treasury

Every Society and certainly a State must administer its resources in a functional and transparent way. The treasury stack enables forms of management of assets held in common in a flexible and transparent manner.

To serve citizens well, the stack must ensure transparent public expenditure management. Every citizen and community member has access to how common funds are spent, why they are spent, and the relative performance of each spend. Essential decisions and flows are entirely on-chain, minimizing or eliminating the need for trust by creating an enduring truthful layer.

Initially Jur offers a simple and flexible system. The treasury allows the founder to create committees. A committee supervises the funding requests (projects) of the community members and approves or denies them. Projects are divided into milestones and both are public.

The stack allows [Oracles](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/0gcIfR6h7zg1xTLArrpK/s/okj7thnKilfPHcTFjg4U/) to approve claimed milestones or reject claims that a milestone has been achieved, in which case the claim goes to a [dispute resolution system](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/0gcIfR6h7zg1xTLArrpK/s/okj7thnKilfPHcTFjg4U/).

The difference between Jurâ€™s Treasury stack and the [Polkadot Treasury](https://polkadot.network/treasury/) module is that this element is designed in the context of a community and not necessarily a layer 0. With Jur there is no incentive to spend the funds in a specific time frame.

In the initial version, it is the founder's responsibility to define the specific disclosure for committee members. For example the founder might require the creation of reports to support each decision. The Module is flexible and can support various types of needs of organized groups.

Jur Treasury will evolve allowing various models of public expenditure management, including models where citizens participate in budget processes either directly or indirectly by electing committee members.

Later versions will include impartial expenditure monitors and impact assessment systems for each expenditure. The initial vision is to allow the production of on-chain data for a Web3 citizenship dashboard where every detail of the collective expenditure is publicly accessible in a way that allows citizens to comment.

Our vision is evolving towards the creation of a Web3 Citizenship Dashboard: the place where modern citizens can easily discover truthful data and contribute to the decisions of their social organization.
