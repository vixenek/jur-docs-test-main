# ðŸ§™ Oracle

The need to make subjective evaluations is a necessity in any organized group. Some assessments may technical in nature, for example assessing the quality of a scientific work and its compliance with scientific publication standards. Other valuations may be non-technical in nature.

Jur creates an Oracle Module that allows Societies to form committees. Initially, the Committee will express its opinion with a simple majority vote; later additional voting methods will be added. The creation of Committees and mechanisms for selecting members is the (delegatable) responsibility of the founder of the Society.

In future, the Jur stack will enable different models of voting, decentralized creation of expert polls and qualitative ranking by peer review. Future versions will include a range of choices of sophisticated voting mechanisms and dedicated reputation systems for supporting qualitative, truthful-by-design decisions and assessments.\

From a broader perspective, to scale up, web3 needs needs tools for subjective assessments. The leap between the first wave of web3 constituted by predominantly financial applications and the second wave of social applications will be accomplished with advanced composable oracle systems. Jur will lead this specific vertical through continuous iteration.
