# Benefits of an Autonomous Chain

Blockchains are not one size fits all. Use cases in human organization and coordination need specific features.

The Web3 vertical for societies, network states, and countries is new and large. It requires an infrastructure designed for that purpose both technically and economically. Using a multi-purpose blockchain would expose socially sensitive use cases to the dynamics for example of other industries (e.g., network congestion resulting from a spike in NFTs sales).

Not least, the governance area is socially and politically sensitive. It is critically important to be able to ensure a dedicated yet secure autonomous governance system in order to ensure protocol development in the direction capable of satisfying Jur's specific needs at best.

To sum up, developing an autonomous specialized chain for a dedicated use case presents several benefits:

* **efficiency**: for example, avoiding network congestions due to the existence of over usage coming from other verticals, e.g. Cryptokitties
* **customization**: the chain can customise and evolve in the direction for serving at best a specific set of use cases
* **long-term reliability**: users can rely on a foundational layer who will constantly evolve for serving better their specific needs, instead of potentially different areas of Web3 that have different needs
* **stability**: users need to rely on a chain whose governance serves a coherent set of needs. Developing protocols on a general purpose blockchain exposes to changes that might affect negatively affect the type of solution developed. If this balance is acceptable for certain use cases, it can't be sustainable for use cases in the macro-governance spectrum upon which delicate balances for large size of people are affected
