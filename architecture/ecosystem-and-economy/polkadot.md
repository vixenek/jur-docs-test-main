# ðŸŸ£ Polkadot

Jur is the specialized blockchain focused on the entire ecosystem governance, enabling Network States and Web3 adoption by pre-existing states. Security is, therefore, of primary value to Jur. Building on Polkadot Jur has access from day 1 to guaranteed security from a multi-billion worth network.

Substrate is a framework that allows customized runtimes to be built quickly, enabling Jur not to reinvent the wheel or invest time iterating on areas common to multiple chains.

Not least, the future of Web3 is interoperable and multi-chain environments will be the future. Jur will take full advantage of the interoperability offered by Polkadot.
