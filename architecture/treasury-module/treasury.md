# Treasury

The Treasury pallet allows a Community to manage a set of Assets (i.e. funds) that it can grant to initiatives led by community members. A Treasury consists of the following:

| Treasury Component | Description                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| identifier         | A unique identifier that allows a Community to own multiple treasuries |
| assets             | A list of all assets owned listed by type and balance                  |
| committee          | Members of the Community appointed to approve Projects and fund them   |
| oracle\_identifier | An entity that approves a Milestone as completed or not                |

A Treasuryâ€™s Committee analyzes and evaluates Projects that can be proposed by any community member that belongs to the Community the Treasury is associated with.
