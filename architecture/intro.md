# ðŸ”¤ Intro

Jur is a Layer 1 blockchain built with the [Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/) framework and that will become a parachain on the Polkadot Relay Chain through [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus).

Jurâ€™s runtime will offer a set of pallets that will allow the creation of censorship-resistant communities and empower them with a stack that allows them to eventually evolve in more mature forms of communities.

Communities have a plethora of needs starting from:

* aggregating members on a purpose/cause
* being able to maintain a commonality over time
* adding/removing members
* managing economic activities within the community
* facilitate trade between community members
* provide methods to handle disagreements

Aside from this Jur has envisioned infrastructure bits for evolving online communities into more complex forms of community: a Nation and a State. Eventually Jurâ€™s stack supports the entire journey of a community starting just as a set of members sharing common values, transitioning into a Nation based out of a territory (that can be both digital and physical) and a State with eventually its own government and diplomatic recognition by existing States.

## Overview

Here is an overview of the current architecture of the Jur Stack which includes:

* [Community Module](broken-reference)
* [Treasury Module](treasury-module/)
* [Oracle Module](oracle-module/)
* [Dispute Resolution Modules](dispute-resolution-module/)
* Trade Modules (WIP)
