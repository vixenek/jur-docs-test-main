# Community

This pallet allows the creation of a Community which is the foundational building block of a future Network State.

A Community is created and led by a Founder that sets the initial set of values that will define the Community.

The stack will allow the Community to make Proposals and vote in order to change any core values, although a founder could choose to opt out of this feature and retain central control. In its initial version it is on the Founder to abide by these results and update the values.

In subsequent versions and after feedback from our community the journey will be completed by adding the properties associated with Nations and States.
