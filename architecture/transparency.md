# ðŸ‘“ Transparency

Being a Web3 project and a responsible stakeholder in the Jur ecosystem, Jur AG has chosen to be transparent about its token management to keep the community and other contributors informed. Jur also commits to the high level of compliance required by the Swiss authorities and is audited by Grant Thornton and monitored by the VQF.

In order to accomplish this degree of transparency, Jur publishes quarterly market reports within the first 10 days after the end of the quarter to update its stakeholders. This report highlights business and product development, expenditures, department updates, among others. All market reports released are available on Jurâ€™s official blog, [here](https://jur.io/blog/category/announcements/).
