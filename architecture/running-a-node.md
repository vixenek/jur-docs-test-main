# 🌐 Running a Node

A minimum set of three collators will be maintained by our ecosystem partners to make sure block production proceeds smoothly.

If you wish to run a node, we appreciate your interest.

More information on this will be provided at a later date. Jur doesn’t currently have a specific plan for rewarding collators.
