# Dispute

The Dispute pallet provides all the information relevant to the dispute: plaintiff/defendant accounts, agreement hash, claim hash, resolution proof, resolution deadline, resolution method (e.g. arbitration) and other accessory fields.

This structure allows for a Court to provide different types of resolution according to the specific dispute’s needs. We don’t envision large claims in the beginning phase but this would allow the system to potentially handle larger disputes with an arbitration procedure that can be carried out, for example, through the Jur Arbitration Platform.

The aim is to keep things simple in order to iterate with real dispute’s data instead of over-engineering the infrastructure on day 1.
