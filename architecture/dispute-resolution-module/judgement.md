Lastly the Judgment pallet holds the data relevant for a single resolution, namely a resolution proposal approved by a vote of the panel members with the vote count. A simple majority of the panel is used to finalize the outcome of the judgment. This makes the process of resolving a dispute transparent to the disputants.
