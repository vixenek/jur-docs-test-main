# ðŸ—³ Governance

Given the current evolution of the Dotsama ecosystem with the introduction of Gov2, Jurâ€™s runtime does not include any democracy related pallets in its first release ([democracy](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet\_democracy/index.html), [elections](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet\_election\_provider\_multi\_phase/index.html), [referenda](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet\_referenda/index.html)).

The intention is to observe and assess the experience of existing communities and eventually opt-in either for Gov1, Gov2 or create a custom-made governance pallet designed specifically for Jurâ€™s use cases.

\
Current runtime upgrades will be supported by the [sudo pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet\_sudo/index.html), which will be managed directly by the Jur team. This will allow for faster iterations and upgrades exactly as per our needs given the dynamic nature of our industry.
