# Oracle

The Oracle pallet allows the creation of a panel of members that can provide their expertise to assess something in exchange of a fee (optional).

This pallet sets the base properties of the Oracle such as required skills or certifications and the duration of an assessment.

An Oracle could be used by a member of any Community to assess any fact/outcome but the first use case we are envisioning is assessing whether Milestones related to a Project have been completed as per the scope of work. This will allow the Treasury’s Committee to disburse funds to the beneficiary of the specific Milestone that is considered completed. An oracle is defined as follows:

| Oracle Component   | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| identifier         | A unique identifier for the Oracle                                           |
| members            | Members of the Oracle                                                        |
| fee                | To be paid to the Oracle for an Assessment                                   |
| assessment\_period | The deadline for the Oracle to provide an Assessment                         |
| description        | A long text description of the services provided by the Oracle and the “how” |
| skills             | A list of specific skills of Oracle members in terms of their expertise      |

In subsequent versions of the Oracle pallet we envision the members to be able to provide different fees according to the level of expertise needed, the category of the assessment and the assessment period (e.g. if an Assessment is urgent the user may be willing to pay more for it).
