# Assessment

The Assessment pallet envisions a data structure that stores a reference to what is being assessed, approval/rejection counts of the claim and the status (e.g. voting) and the deadline within which the members of the Oracle will be delivering the assessment to the client.

An Assessment can be carried out on any activity the user is willing to pay for.

In subsequent versions the Assessment may have multiple statuses allowing a further level of complexity to be handled.
