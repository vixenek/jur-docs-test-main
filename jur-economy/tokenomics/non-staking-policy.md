# Non-Staking Policy

In order not to prejudice $JUR holders and their weJUR score, Jur commits to not staking with the $JUR tokens in its possession. The vision is to reward active actors of the ecosystem, promoting a progressive decentralization approach.&#x20;

### Context

Jur is the distillate of years of development and milestones achieved in a Web3 Governance vertical. Jur began as focusing on a component of the current Network State stack, Dispute Resolution. More information about some of the milestones achieved by Jur is in the [About Us Section](https://gitbook.jur.io/jur-documentation/about-us).&#x20;

In 2019 it created an initial dApp and generated the $JUR token to enable its operation.  The Initial Exchange Offering model enabled a minimal initial market allocation, equivalent to 10 percent of the Tokens. The vision at the time was for a gradual release of the tokens, contextual to the maturity of the project. Jur has successfully promoted a policy of progressive release according to canons of prudence, selecting strategic partners and contributors interested in the long-term success of the project. &#x20;

In the evolution of Jur into layer 1, the Quota dedicated to Protocol and Business Development and Company Reserve has been reallocated with the goal of ensuring the sustainability and growth of Jur as a project and as an ecosystem. Jur has followed the principle of "improve, never diminish." Jur maintained the highest level of commitment to the community. The Team Tokens for 10% initially virtually available to be released on a vesting schedule, have not been released.&#x20;
