# $JUR Staking and the $DOT bonding for parachain slots

The staking of $JUR tokens works similarly, but differently, from the bonding of $DOTs in Polkadot. $DOT holders bond $DOTs in crowdloans to support specific parachains on Polkadot and receive rewards from the crowdloan in which they participated. These rewards are normally paid in parachains' native tokens.&#x20;

Similarly, $JUR holders can stake $JUR tokens to support new Societies on Jur and receive their native tokens; they stake and receive tokens from each Society created (see The [$JUR Holder Journey](https://app.gitbook.com/o/0gcIfR6h7zg1xTLArrpK/s/jMNQSqk1n74rnFDPrhBu/\~/changes/MDCk1IuX4EPqXimx9US0/jur-economy/usdjur-staking-meta-citizenship/the-usdjur-holder-journey)).&#x20;

This logic is designed to avoid compartmentalized interests in specific societies. Rather, a meta-citizen will be incentivized by the success of the ecosystem. For example, society models that are strong in terms of initial social value and less so in the initial internal economy model will find equal support and participation from meta-citizens, and are likely to be the recipients of a major part of the Societies Rewards.&#x20;

The model favors the intent to infuse a cooperative dynamic into the ecosystem rather than a competitive one. At present, there is no scarcity of slots available for Societies and Network States on Jur.
