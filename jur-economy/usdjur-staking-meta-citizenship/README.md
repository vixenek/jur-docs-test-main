# ðŸ¦¹ $JUR Staking: Meta-Citizenship

Given the scope of the Jur ecosystem, each Society will have its own internal economy. For some it will be informal; for others it will be  formalized with a native cryptocurrency.

Jur enables the creation of new internal economiesâ€“ new forms of social organization that may one day coordinate millions of individuals. Jur is agnostic; it does not take a position on specific economic models, but enables a variety of them. \
New economies that arise on Jur will share a trustless stack, the Jur Chain. The architecture of the Jur Chain runtime is available [here](https://gitbook.jur.io/jur-documentation/architecture).
