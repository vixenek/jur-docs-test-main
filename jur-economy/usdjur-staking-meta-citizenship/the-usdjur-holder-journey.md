# The $JUR Holder Journey

Meta-citizenship represents a cross-citizenship across multiple societies built on Jur. $JUR holders can participate directly in societal development through staking. $JUR holders become a meta-citizen by staking a minimum amount of $JUR tokens (5,000 $JUR).&#x20;

Upon the creation of a new society or Network States token (e.g. $DSTATE), a percentage is distributed via Airdrop to meta-citizens, in proportion to the amount and duration of staking.

Another benefit of being a meta-citizen will be to vote on societies that receive Society Rewards. This active participation enables the receipt of airdrops. This mechanic generates direct meta-citizen interest in each society in the entire ecosystem and direct power to direct ecosystem growth. The voting system will evolve following iterations with the community, and will be tested prior to the launch of the first Society Tokens.
