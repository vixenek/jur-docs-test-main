# weJUR score

The weJURs score is an on-chain system for defining $JUR holder’s weight of $JUR staked. The weJUR score is attributed to a wallet and can't be transferred. The initial formula that generates the weJUR score is related to the time and quantity of $JUR tokens staked.&#x20;

The weJUR score will evolve over time with input from the community to reflect holders’ participation in Jur-based societies and active contributions to the ecosystem.&#x20;

Holders determine the duration of their staking and can unstake anytime. weJUR rewards accrue on a daily basis. Thus the weJUR score for a holder staking $JUR will constantly increase for as long as the $JUR are staked. When the holder withdraws their $JUR from the staking contract, if the total staking amount doesn't meet the minimum requirements to be a meta-citizen, the weJUR score is reset to zero.
