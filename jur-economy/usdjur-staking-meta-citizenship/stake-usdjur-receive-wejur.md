# Stake $JUR, receive weJUR

Web3 has learned that there is a need for communities to align for the right reasons. APY, while very attractive, often only encourages economic alignment. Jur aims to support members who believe in the true vision of Network States and cross-citizenships to bring momentum and energy to the ecosystem while being economically aligned. Models of providing ownership to members are continuously evolving. The weJUR score is how Jur provides ownership while capturing and honoring contributions made by members.

Meta-citizenship allows for staking $JUR and receiving weJUR points based on the amount and duration of staking. weJUR points determine a weJUR score. &#x20;

The meta-citizen Staking Rewards work in this way: &#x20;

* **$JUR Staking.** Staking 1 $JUR tokens produces 1 weJUR point every 24 hours. As such, staking $1JUR continuously throughout the year will add 365 weJUR points to the holderâ€™s weJUR score.
* [**Meta-Citizen Rewards.**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] A portion of supply of every Society Token is airdropped (0.1% minimum) to meta-citizens in proportion to their weJUR scores during the Initial Society Token Offering. The required 0.1% amount is small enough that it cannot reasonably be seen as a significant burden for any Society Founder. Every Founder can airdrop a higher amount in order to receive more active contributions from meta-citizens:

The meta-citizen reward is calculated as follows:

For example, a Network State issuing $PEACE token will airdrop 0.5% of its 1B token issuance to the meta-citizens, in proportion to their weJUR score. Assuming that a meta-citizen has 10,000 weJUR points and that the total amount of weJUR is 1M, then the reward will be calculated as (10k \* 1B) / 1M = 100k $PEACE.

Anyone can become a meta-citizen by purchasing and staking $JUR tokens. As a reminder, Jur has adopted a plan of [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/). The meta-citizen concept, based on $JUR token ownership, will generate traction for early society Founders, solving the cold start problem.&#x20;

Future iterations will introduce different logic dictated not only by $JUR possession but also by actual contribution to the ecosystem. Such logic will insert a push from an ownership-based model to one in which both action and ownership determine relevance and reputation in the ecosystem. Future citizenship releases may include functionalities of $JUR lockup and meta-citizen passports.&#x20;
