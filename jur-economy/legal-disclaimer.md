**LEGAL DISCLAIMERS**

**No offer of securities or registration**

The Document does not constitute a Prospectus or offer document of any sort and is not intended to constitute an offer of securities or a solicitation for investment in securities in any jurisdiction. No person is bound to enter into any contract or binding legal commitment, and no cryptocurrency or other forms of payment are to be accepted on the basis of the Document.

**Changes to the Jur platform**

Various features of the Jur platform, including its terms and conditions, fees, structure, purpose, consensus protocol, algorithm, source codes, infrastructure design and other technical specifications and parameters, may be updated and changed from time to time without notice.

**Potential for misuse of the Jur platform**

Services which may be banned, restricted in certain jurisdictions may potentially use the Jur platform. As a result, governmental authorities or regulators may take action against the Jur platform. This may deter users from using the Jur platform or may involve the complete shutdown of the Jur platform.

**Possible migration of the $JUR Tokens**&#x20;

The $JUR Token is created as VIP 180 token-contract. Jur AG reserves the right to migrate the $JUR tokens to another protocol, such as a native blockchain, and to generate replacement Tokens on the new protocol in the future, should Jur AG determine, in its sole discretion, that doing so is necessary or useful to the operation of the Jur platform. Should Jur AG decide to migrate the $JUR Tokens, Jur may no longer provide support for the pre-existing tokens or any other operational matters, except with respect to the migration process.&#x20;

**No assets or property underlying $JUR Tokens**&#x20;

$JUR Tokens confer no ownership interest in any assets or property. Nothing underpins the value of $JUR Tokens other than the prospect of the Jur platform access, usage and functionality.

**No governance rights attaching to $JUR Tokens**

$JUR Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Jur platform or Jur AG. Accordingly, subject to other written arrangements to the contrary, all decisions involving the Jur platform will be made by Jur AG, including decisions to discontinue the Jur platform. These decisions could adversely affect the Jur platform and the utility of any $JUR Tokens that you hold.

**No securities**

$JUR Tokens are not to be construed, interpreted, classified or treated as debentures, stocks or shares issued by any person or entity, rights, options or derivatives in respect of such debentures, stocks or shares, rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the purpose or pretended purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss, units in a collective investment scheme, structured products, units in a business trust, derivatives of units in a business trust.

**Volatility of cryptocurrencies, other digital assets and fiat currencies**

Jur AG may hold the proceeds in cryptocurrencies, other digital assets or fiat currencies, or a combination of any of them. The value of these fiat currencies and digital assets may fluctuate significantly over a short period of time as a result of market dynamics, regulatory actions and changes, technical advancements, exchange availability and broader economic and political factors. This volatility is likely to impact the funding that is available for developing the Jur platform and may affect the utility of the $JUR Tokens.

**Legal status of $JUR Tokens and Jur platform is untested**

The laws of various jurisdictions may apply to $JUR Tokens and the Jur platform. The application of these laws and regulations to $JUR Tokens and the Jur platform is, in many cases, largely untested, and is subject to change without notice. In particular, any current governmental or regulatory tolerance of cryptographic tokens or cryptocurrencies can change rapidly, and $JUR Tokens may at any time be deemed to be a security, investment, asset or money by governmental authorities or regulators.

**Tax treatment and accounting**

Jur AG, purchaser and transactions in relation to the $JUR Tokens and/or the Jur platform may be subject to the tax laws and regulations in any applicable jurisdictions. The tax treatment and accounting of transactions in relation to the $JUR Tokens and/or the Jur platform are uncertain and a largely untested area of law and practice that is subject to prospective and retroactive changes without notice. Tax treatment of cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies may vary amongst jurisdictions.

Purchasing $JUR Tokens or the use of the Jur platform as a result of or in connection with any purchase, grant, delivery, exercise, vesting, distribution, activation, holding, use, appreciation, conversion, sale, exchange, redemption, assignment, transfer, disposal, may attract certain tax implications either now or in the future.

**No anonymity**

Holding and transfer of $JUR Tokens and use of the Jur platform (if and when developed) will not be anonymous. Your address and such participation will be recorded on a permissionless blockchain. It is possible to match addresses to identities. Furthermore, to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations and in accordance with our privacy statements, disclosure will be made to relevant authorities and regulators upon request.

**Loss of private key is permanent and irreversible**

You alone are responsible for securing your private key. Losing control of your private key will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to your $JUR Tokens. Neither Jur AG nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect your $JUR Tokens. Once lost, you will not be able to transfer your $JUR Tokens to any other address or wallet. You will not be able to realise any value or utility that the $JUR Token may hold now or in the future.

**No liabilities**

Jur AG or any of the Jur team is not liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including but not limited to loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or data), arising out of or in connection with any acceptance of or reliance on this Document or any part thereof by you.\
\
**No advice**

No information in this Document will or should be considered to be business, legal, financial or tax advice regarding Jur AG, $JUR Tokens or any possible future token sales. You must seek professional advice (legal, taxation, financial, technical or otherwise) regarding your particular situation before purchasing $JUR Tokens, holding the $JUR Token or using the Jur platform.

**Restrictions on distribution and dissemination**

The distribution or dissemination of this Document or such part thereof (as the case may be) may be prohibited or restricted by the laws, regulatory requirements and rules of any jurisdiction. In the case where any restriction applies, you are to inform yourself about, and to observe, any restrictions which are applicable to your possession of this Document or such part thereof (as the case may be) at your own expense and without liability to Jur or any of its affiliated entities or any member of the Jur team.

**RISKS DISCLAIMER**

Prospective receivers or purchasers of $JUR Token should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with Jur AG and its business and operations or any of its affiliated entities, the $JUR Token and any possible future token sale, all information set out on the website, in this Document and the purchasing agreement prior to any purchase of $JUR Token. If any of such risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Jur AG could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, you may lose all or part of the value of the $JUR Token.&#x20;

These risks, and additional risks arising either now or in the future, could result in the failure of the $JUR Token transfers, the destruction of $JUR Tokensor the utility of $JUR Tokens, and/or the termination of the development of the Jur platform.

There is a possibility that the purchase amount may be unrecoverable and/or that the $JUR Tokens may cease to have inherent intrinsic value. You must therefore consider carefully whether the risks set out below, as well as all other applicable risks, are acceptable to you prior to deciding whether to purchase $JUR Tokens.

**Abandonment/lack of success**

Jur AG may abandon the creation of the $JUR Token and the development of the Jur platform for various reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects), financial, resourcing and technical difficulties, and legal, tax or regulatory considerations.

**Regulatory risks**

Certain jurisdictions might apply already existing laws and regulations to blockchain technology-based projects or introduce new laws or regulations for this purpose. Newly introduced regulations may differ to the existing setup of the platform. This may cause, inter alia, substantial modifications of the Jur platform or bring to the termination and/or the loss of $JUR Tokens.

**Jurisdiction-related risks**

Residents, tax residents or persons having a relevant connection with certain jurisdictions are excluded from the $JUR Token sale. Changes in your place of domicile or the applicable law may result in you violating any legal or regulatory requirements of your applicable jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring that the delivery, holding, use or exchange of $JUR Tokens is, and remains lawful despite changes to applicable laws, your residence and circumstances.

**Reliance on the Internet**

$JUR Tokens and the Jur platform rely heavily on the internet. However, the public nature of the internet means that either parts of the internet or the entire internet may be unreliable or unavailable at any given time. Further, interruption, delay, corruption or loss of data, or the loss of confidentiality in the transmission of data, may occur when transmitting data via the internet.

**Reliance on Blockchain**&#x20;

$JUR Tokens and the Jur platform rely on a third-party blockchain platform. Such a blockchain platform may be open source software that is built upon experimental technology, namely blockchain. Risks arising from this reliance include (but are not limited to):

* the existence of technical flaws in such a blockchain platform;
* targeting of such a blockchain platform by malicious persons;
* changes in such a blockchain platform’s consensus protocol or algorithms;
* decreased community or miner support for such a blockchain platform;
* the existence or development of competing networks and platforms;
* the existence or development of forked versions of such a blockchain platform;
* flaws in the source code scripting language;
* disputes between such a blockchain platform developers, miners and/or users; and
* regulatory action against such a blockchain platform developers, miners and/or users.

**Source code changes and flaws**

The various source codes used in the $JUR Token and the Jur platform are subject to change and may at any time contain one or more defects, weaknesses, inconsistencies, errors or bugs.\
