# ⚓ Insurance

Ultimately, governments and states are abstracted forms of insurance. In abstract terms, the same concept of a society with it's own “supporting personal network” is a form of reciprocal insurance: “Family and friends take care of me and loved ones in case of need.”

Two future Modules of Jur will be:

* **Reciprocity**: a committee that supports when a member of the society or his family asks for help. The committee gets nominated by the founder in v1. The committee acts to support the society member in need.
* **Insurance**: a society with this module activated acts as a simplified form of insurance, supporting its members in case of need.
