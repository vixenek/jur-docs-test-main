# ‚úç Legislative

The legislative module enables the creation of DAOs that approve and maintain Standards, Rules and forms of rules in a decentralized and opt-in manner.

The vision is to enable the creation of Standards of rules that Societies and States can opt into. These standards can be invoked by on-chain logic so as to increase the scope of the executive logic with non-deterministic prescriptions.
