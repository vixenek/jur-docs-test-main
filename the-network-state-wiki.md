# ðŸªŸ The Network State Wiki

As you have seen this whole concept of the Network State is new, and this is why the Jur community came together and created as a community effort [this Wiki](https://gitbook.jur.io/wiki-network-state/).

The Network State is a new concept. It is just taking shape. As people experiment and create new societies, the concept will evolve. What we know about the Network State today is just the beginning. But it is a solid beginning; many people have explored the concept and there is a growing body of knowledge around it, how citizens can benefit from this movement, and what it will take to realize the vision. And the effort continues.
